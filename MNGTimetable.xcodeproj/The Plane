# 5. The Plane
## 5.1 Vector and component form
Let the plane e be determined by the points A, B, C

The position vector r of a general point P e E can be written as the sum of the position vector of a given point A e E and a linear combiation of two non collinear direction vectors AB and AC.

[image vector form]

If we think of the vector form representing a 3x5 system of simultaneous linear equations we get:

[image component form]

Remark: As for the line the comoponents of the direction vector are supposed to be whole numbers without common dividers.
Example: E = M(18/6/96), N(24/7/95), G(21/3/98)
